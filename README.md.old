1. `request_from_igdb.py`: https://api-docs.igdb.com/#getting-started

(You can try to download the data or just look at `igdb_response.json`, no price at all)

2. `request_from_itad.py`: https://docs.isthereanydeal.com/#tag/Prices/operation/games-overview-v2

(**not yet**, but itad shows price histories, such as https://isthereanydeal.com/game/xuan-yuan-sword-vii/history/)

3. `request_from_steampowered.py`: https://api.steampowered.com

(only initial price and final price, no history, as shown in `price_overview` in `steam_app_data.csv`)

(required a app_id list, can be generated by the next request)

4. `request_from_steampy.py`: https://steamspy.com/api.php and https://nik-davis.github.io/posts/2019/steam-data-collection/

(data should be the same as the last request, also only initial price and final price, no history)

        Have you ever wondered if that much-anticipated game in your wishlist
        will go on sale soon?<br />
        Or if there’s a perfect time to buy it without stretching your
        budget?<br />
        Look no further!<br />
        Our <strong>Video Game Price Discount Predictor</strong> is designed to
        be your gaming companion, helping you get the best deals with precision
        and ease.
      </p>
      <h2>Why Predict Prices?</h2>
      <p>
        Unlike grocery prices or smartphone prices, game prices are
        unpredictable — changing with genres, quality, popularity, and even the
        pubilsher's mood. It can be irritating to buy a game at full price, only
        to see it on sale a few days later. It can even be frustrating to wait
        for a sale that never comes. With thousands of games out there, keeping
        up with price trends for each one is tough. Even though there are deals
        websites like IsThereAnyDeal and GGDeals, it can still be emotionally
        hurting to wait for half a year and receive a 10 euros off.
      </p>
      <p>
        That’s where our tool comes in, leveraging data-driven insights to
        predict when 50% discounts might appear, helping you plan purchases more
        wisely. Imagine having a personalized sale alert system,
        <strong
          >you’re always <span class="marker">far ahead of</span> the best
          deals. You don't wait or you don't overpay. You game smarter.</strong
        >
      </p>

      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <p>
        We built our predictor using a robust algorithm trained on years of
        price data and multiple internal factors (e.g. genres, pubilshers,
        platforms) and external factors (e.g. user scores) from various sources.
        By analyzing trends, the tool estimates when the price may drop 50% off.
        Simply add a game, and we’ll provide you with insights on whether to
        wait for a discount or buy it now, helping you to:
      </p>
